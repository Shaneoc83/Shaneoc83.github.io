I am having trouble getting the api key integrated(should have done it from the start)
For now the only way to test the funstionality of this app is to download it to your machine and run it locally.


The app itself is a Frankenstein in so far as it was pieced together from disparate pieces, never intending to be what it is.

Enter the latitude and longitude and a placename , click enter.
The application will jump to those co-ordinates and when clicked upon will display the name you entered.
I use it as a guessing game for now.
It will be modified into a purpose other than that it has now.
